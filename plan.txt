# GolfIMU System Implementation Plan
# Getting Teensy 4.0 + IMU Connected and Data Flowing

## OVERVIEW
This plan outlines the step-by-step process to get your GolfIMU system fully operational, from hardware connection to live golf swing data collection.

## PHASE 1: HARDWARE SETUP & VERIFICATION (Goal 1)
**Objective**: Get Teensy 4.0 and BNO08x IMU connected and confirm hardware is working

  - USB-C to USB dongle for Teensy connection
  - Breadboard and jumper wires
  - Computer USB power (3.3V from Teensy)

- [ ] Wire the IMU to Teensy 4.0 (CONFIRMED SETUP):
  - VIN → 3.3V (powered from Teensy)
  - GND → GND  
  - SDA → Pin 18 (I2C data)
  - SCL → Pin 19 (I2C clock)
  - INT → Pin 16 (interrupt)
  - RST → Not connected (optional)

### Step 1.2: Firmware Upload & Testing
- [ ] Install Arduino IDE with Teensy support
- [ ] Install required libraries:
  - SparkFun_BNO08x_Arduino_Library
  - Wire library (built-in)

- [ ] Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to verify:
  - Firmware version message
  - "BNO08x connected!" message
  - JSON data stream showing IMU readings
  - Status reports every 1000 samples

### Step 1.3: Hardware Validation Tests
- [ ] **Static Test**: Verify IMU readings are stable when stationary
- [ ] **Movement Test**: Wave the IMU around to see changing values
- [ ] **Sample Rate Test**: Confirm 1000Hz data rate in status messages
- [ ] **Range Test**: Verify accelerometer shows ±16g range capability

## PHASE 2: BACKEND INTEGRATION (Goal 2)
**Objective**: Confirm data is being read from IMU and logged into backend

### Step 2.1: Backend Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify Python environment:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/jonahsachs/Desktop/GolfIMU
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- [ ] Start Redis server:
  ```bash
  redis-server redis.conf
  ```
- [ ] Verify Redis is running:
  ```bash
  redis-cli ping
  # Should return: PONG
  ```

### Step 2.2: Serial Communication Testing
- [ ] Run backend:
  ```bash
  python backend/run_backend.py
  ```
- [ ] Test Arduino connection:
  ```
  connect_arduino
  ```
- [ ] Verify connection status:
  ```
  status
  ```
- [ ] Test IMU data streaming:
  ```
  start_session test_user driver 1.07 0.205
  send_config
  start_monitoring
  ```

### Step 2.3: Data Flow Verification
- [ ] **Raw Data Test**: Verify JSON data is being received from Teensy
- [ ] **Parsing Test**: Confirm IMU data is being parsed correctly
- [ ] **Storage Test**: Verify data is being stored in Redis
- [ ] **Session Test**: Confirm session management is working

### Step 2.4: Data Quality Validation
- [ ] **Sample Rate Verification**: Confirm 1000Hz data rate maintained
- [ ] **Data Completeness**: Verify all 9-DOF sensors (accel, gyro, mag, quat)
- [ ] **Timestamp Accuracy**: Check data timestamps are consistent
- [ ] **Buffer Management**: Confirm no data loss during transmission

## PHASE 3: SWING DETECTION & ANALYSIS (Goal 3)
**Objective**: Implement swing detection and prepare for live golf testing

### Step 3.1: Impact Detection Implementation
- [ ] **Threshold Testing**: Test different g-force thresholds (5g-100g)
- [ ] **Swing Buffer**: Implement pre/post impact data buffering
- [ ] **False Positive Filtering**: Add noise filtering to prevent false triggers
- [ ] **Swing Validation**: Add swing duration and pattern validation

### Step 3.2: Data Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Swing Segmentation**: Implement swing start/end detection
- [ ] **Data Compression**: Optimize data transmission for complete swings
- [ ] **Quality Metrics**: Add swing quality indicators
- [ ] **Real-time Processing**: Implement live swing analysis

### Step 3.3: System Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Test**: Complete swing capture and storage
- [ ] **Performance Test**: Verify system can handle rapid successive swings
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test system recovery from various failure modes
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Verify data survives system restarts

## PHASE 4: LIVE GOLF TESTING PREPARATION
**Objective**: Prepare for real golf club testing

### Step 4.1: Physical Mounting
- [ ] **Mounting Design**: Create secure mounting for Teensy + IMU on golf club
- [ ] **Cable Management**: Ensure USB cable doesn't interfere with swing
- [ ] **Power Supply**: Verify stable power during swings
- [ ] **Protection**: Add protection against impact and moisture

### Step 4.2: Calibration & Validation
- [ ] **Static Calibration**: Calibrate IMU in known orientations
- [ ] **Dynamic Calibration**: Test with controlled swing motions
- [ ] **Club-Specific Setup**: Configure for specific club characteristics
- [ ] **User-Specific Setup**: Configure for user swing characteristics

### Step 4.3: Live Testing Protocol
- [ ] **Test Environment**: Set up testing area with computer nearby
- [ ] **Data Collection Plan**: Define what data to collect and analyze
